# Example Prompts for Claude Desktop

A copy/paste library of natural-language requests you can drop straight into Claude Desktop (or Cursor, or any MCP client connected to this server) to drive **scm-mcp-mssp**. No tool names or JSON required — just ask.

**252 examples** across 33 categories, mirroring [`TOOL_REFERENCE.md`](TOOL_REFERENCE.md).

## Before you start

- **Placeholders.** `Acme Corp`, `Contoso Ltd`, `Meridian Health`, `Customer-A`, `acme-corp`, and branch names like `Manchester-Branch-12` are stand-ins. Swap them for your own tenant labels and SCM folder names — Claude will pick the right `tenant_id`/`folder` from what you type as long as it roughly matches a configured tenant.
- **Single-tenant setups.** If you're not running in MSSP mode, drop the tenant name from any prompt below — every tool falls back to your default tenant automatically.
- **`folder` matters.** Most config-read/write tools scope to an SCM folder (`Shared`, `Prisma Access`, `Remote Networks`, or a per-customer folder). If you don't specify one, Claude will ask or use a sensible default — naming it up front avoids a back-and-forth.
- **Write operations are safe by default.** Anything that creates, deletes, or changes config (address objects, security rules, NCSC baselines, SSR changes, config-orch writes) defaults to a dry run and won't touch your tenant until you explicitly say "apply it" / "make it live" / "set dry_run to false".
- **Long-running jobs.** AS-BUILT reports, all-tenant drift sweeps, and Planner runs return a job ID and keep working in the background — just ask "check on that job" a minute later.

212. "Give me a Prisma Access Browser summary for Acme Corp — users by status, devices by OS, posture compliance."
213. "List all PAB-enrolled devices for Contoso Ltd running macOS."
214. "Show me the PAB application catalog for Customer-A — I want to see what's already configured before adding a new app."
215. "List the app groups configured in Prisma Access Browser for Acme Corp."
216. "Show me the open helpdesk queue of user access requests in PAB for Contoso Ltd."

## 30. Planner (Autonomous Agent)

_Conversational goal-to-plan execution, incident triage, estate-wide checks._

217. "Run an autonomous check across all tenants: find which ones have certificates expiring this quarter and summarise per customer."
218. "Check the status of the Planner run I kicked off a minute ago."
219. "Fetch the final report from that Planner run once it's done."
220. "Trigger incident-response triage for this alert: an IPSec tunnel just went down on branch-12 for Acme Corp — here's the raw alert JSON: {\"message\": \"IPSec tunnel down on branch-12\"}."
221. "Run the tier-aware estate check across every configured tenant."
222. "Run the estate check but limit it to just `acme-corp` and `contoso-ltd`, concurrency 2."
223. "Ask the Planner to investigate why Contoso Ltd's mobile users can't connect and, if it finds a fix that needs a commit, don't apply it — just report back what it would do."
224. "Run a Planner goal: 'audit every Gold-tier tenant for NCSC CAF gaps and rank them by how many critical findings each has' — read-only, no write tools approved."

## 31. Service Status

_Public PAN cloud maintenance windows and incident status._

225. "Are there any upcoming PAN cloud maintenance windows relevant to Acme Corp's region in the next 14 days?"
226. "Show me maintenance windows across every configured tenant, grouped per tenant, for the next 30 days."
227. "Check current PAN cloud status, including Prisma Cloud and Cortex, not just SASE products."

## 32. SSR (Simple Service Requests)

_Restricted, idempotent customer-change CRUD — URL allow/block lists, threat exceptions, decrypt exclusions._

228. "Add `partner-portal.example.com` to Acme Corp's SSR-managed URL allow list, ticket ref INC-8842 — dry run first."
229. "That looks right, apply it for real."
230. "Remove `known-bad-site.net` from Contoso Ltd's SSR URL block list, ticket ref INC-9011."
231. "Add threat ID `91234` to the threat-exception list for Customer-A's anti-spyware profile, ticket ref CHG-2210, and show me the before/after diff before applying."
232. "Exclude the `financial-services` URL category from SSL decryption on Customer-A's no-decrypt rule, ticket ref CHG-2211 — dry run first, please."

## 33. Cross-Tool Workflows

_Multi-step requests that chain several tools together — the kind of thing an MSSP engineer actually asks for._

233. "Give me a full health check across every MSSP tenant: NOC dashboard, incident summary, and licence forecast, all in one go."
234. "Before I hand this AS-BUILT to the customer, verify it against live config, and if anything drifted, tell me exactly what to regenerate."
235. "Run a BPA assessment for Acme Corp, then use the AI compliance advisor to turn the worst findings into a remediation playbook I can send them."
236. "Check Contoso Ltd's certificate expiry, licence forecast, and SD-WAN software status together — I want one combined risk picture before their renewal call."
237. "Capture a drift baseline for every tenant tonight, then email me a summary tomorrow of what changed — for now just run the baseline and the check back-to-back so I can see the diff mechanics work."
238. "Onboard Customer-F at Silver tier: check the folder doesn't already exist, dry-run the tier snippet onboarding, then apply the NCSC baseline as a dry run too — don't commit anything yet."
239. "Pull Acme Corp's SD-WAN topology, generate the Mermaid diagram, and also generate the HTML site map — I want both for the AS-BUILT appendix."
240. "Investigate a reported outage at Contoso Ltd's Manchester branch: check SD-WAN events, link health, and WAN IP status for that site, then tell me what's most likely wrong."
241. "Run the full compliance trio for Meridian Health — NCSC CAF, NHS DSPT standards 7-10, and ISO 27001 — and tell me which framework they're weakest against."
242. "Before this quarter's QBR with Acme Corp, pull their renewal brief, MSR for last month, and tier compliance report into one package."
243. "Check whether Customer-A's remote networks in SCM config match what the site-onboarding API shows — flag any discrepancy."
244. "Compare BPA findings between Acme Corp and Contoso Ltd and tell me which tenant is in worse shape and why."
245. "Run a decrypt policy audit and an NCSC gap analysis together for Customer-A, then tell me if the SSL decryption gaps are also NCSC control failures."
246. "For every Gold-tier tenant, run mssp_tier_assess and flag anyone who's fallen below 100% compliance since onboarding."
247. "Pull SD-WAN events and audit logs for the last 24 hours across Acme Corp and correlate — did a config change cause the tunnel flap?"
248. "Check licence forecast and mobile user stats together for Contoso Ltd — are we about to run out of GlobalProtect seats before the licence renews?"
249. "Do a pre-change risk check for Acme Corp: commit preview on the pending changes, plus a fresh drift check, before I let the engineer commit."
250. "Build a one-page exec summary combining the NOC dashboard, incident summary, and any tenants currently breaching their contracted tier."
251. "Cross-check PAB posture compliance against SSPM findings for Customer-A — are the same risky devices showing up in both?"
252. "Kick off AS-BUILT generation for every tenant that doesn't have one on file yet, one at a time, and let me know as each finishes."
