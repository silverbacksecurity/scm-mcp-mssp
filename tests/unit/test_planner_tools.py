"""Planner Phase 3b conversational-tool tests.

The run tool is exercised with a fake engine injected through the module's
test seam, so no Anthropic call happens; status/result are pure reads over
the PlanStore. Registration coverage is enforced separately by
test_planner_manifest.py (the tools must have manifest entries).
