## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **MSR round 2 — bandwidth vs allocation, mobile users, ADEM, security events** (`audit/msr_report.py`, `tools/msr.py`) — the pack grows from 8 to 11 sections. §7 now compares per-RN-location bandwidth over the review window against the region's allocated bandwidth (SCM bandwidth allocations joined by normalised location name) with utilisation % per row and a ≥90% executive-summary flag; the Insights v3 backend rejects a `between` month filter (500s until the retry adapter gives up), so the query falls back to an honest `last_n_days` window and the section discloses which window was actually used — unmatched allocations still render as allocation-only rows so idle regions show. §8 Mobile Users: unique users connected in the window plus a per-location breakdown (deduplicated by username per location). §9 Digital Experience: ADEM agent experience scores (mobile users + remote networks; 3-day telemetry window, disclosed); a 401 renders the actionable ADEM-scope hint. §10 Security Events: threats detected vs blocked (Critical/High/Medium) from the Monitor API threat summary, with a blocked-count executive bullet. Service stats gain a commit-job count and the unique-MU row. Live-validated on both lab tenants: allocation-only join (50 Mbps europe-northwest), 2 ADEM agent scopes on one tenant / clean RBAC degradation on the other, and real threat counts (481 blocked of 1005; 156 of 372). 22 new tests (647 → 669)

### Fixed
- **Review sweep of the 2026-07-17 API-coverage sprint** — full-code review of the sprint's new modules with fixes and 57 new tests (596 → 647). `config_orch.py`: `delete` was unreachable in `scm_config_orch_bandwidth` and `scm_config_orch_profiles` (the create/update `body_json` gate fired before the delete branch), and all three tools injected `ticket_ref` into the RNHP request body — a field the API doesn't accept, which would have 400'd every applied create/update; the ticket reference now lives in a structured `config_orch_write` audit log and the tool response instead. `sdwan_interface_status`: an unknown `element_id` silently fell back to the **first element in the estate** and returned the wrong element's interfaces — now returns a not-found hint. `sdwan_app_qos`: name-map enrichment moved inside the error envelope. `utils/validation.py`: a missing `jsonschema` package would have raised `NameError` from the except clause instead of degrading to a no-op (import moved to module level with a guard), and `validate_body` now reports **all** schema violations via `iter_errors` instead of only the first. `tools/insights.py`: the tenant-region resolution block was deduplicated (3 copies → `_resolve_region`), and `scm_insights_export`'s `resource` parameter is now optional since status/download actions don't use it. `dlp_incidents_list` echoes the clamped limit. New test files: config_orch (16), validation (12), DLP incidents (6), SD-WAN round 3 (9), Insights export workflow (8)

### Added
- **MSR — Monthly Service Review pack generator** (`tools/msr.py`, `audit/msr_report.py`, `scm_msr_report`) — assembles the per-tenant monthly customer deliverable from sources the server already produces: period-bounded incidents (Incidents API) and config jobs (Jobs API), the cumulative SSR provenance ledger parsed from `ssr_objects` object descriptions, licence/renewal posture (expired >90d compress to a count; recently-expired stay in the table for the renewal conversation), per-location Insights bandwidth snapshot (24h window, disclosed as such), Compliance Center posture at tier-gated depth (Bronze: upgrade note; Silver: framework scores; Gold: + 30-day trend annex for the benchmarked framework — the `-1` scores unassessed frameworks report render as "not assessed", not a percentage), and mechanically computed service stats (MTTR from closed-incident timestamps — honestly n/a when the API carries no resolution times — ack rate, change failure rate). Executive summary leads with ranked worst-first bullets. Every source degrades per-section with a §8 coverage disclosure, never failing the pack. `month` param (YYYY-MM, default previous full month), markdown or DOCX via the bundled pypandoc pipeline. Live-validated on two lab tenants (bronze + gold paths) including a real DOCX; the gold run gathered all five sources with zero errors. Also fixed a latent `parse_any_ts` gap on the way: ISO timestamps with `Z`/offset suffixes (the Incidents API's `raised_time` format) previously parsed to None, which would have silently emptied incident-time correlation in `scm_incident_rca` too. 32 tests
- **SSR intake webhook** (`server_http.py`, `POST /webhook/ssr`) — form/flow front-ends (Power Automate, ITSM business rules) can now submit Simple Service Requests over HTTP. Payload mirrors `scm_ssr_execute` (`operation`, `target`, `ticket_ref` required; `tenant_id`, `folder`, `action`, `dry_run`, `requested_by` optional) with lenient string-bool coercion for form outputs — an unrecognized `dry_run` value always stays dry-run, never flips to execute. Two-phase contract: POST with `dry_run=true` (default) returns the before/after diff for the approval step; re-POST with `dry_run=false` after sign-off. Commit remains a separate `scm_commit` step. Status mapping: 200 planned/applied, 400 malformed request, 422 tool rejection. Because this endpoint can write (unlike the read-only-by-construction `/webhook/ir`), it is gated behind `SCM_MCP_HTTP_SSR_WEBHOOK=1` on top of the existing AuthMiddleware. Companion Power Automate flow design in `docs/ssr-intake-power-automate.md`. 17 tests
- **SD-WAN Depth Round 3** (`tools/sdwan.py`) — 7 new tools completing the SD-WAN depth roadmap: `sdwan_app_qos` (per-application latency/jitter/loss/MOS aggregates from the monitor API), `sdwan_interface_status` (interface operational state sweep across API versions v2.0–v4.21 with per-element fallback), `sdwan_ipfix_config` (IPFIX profiles, collector/filter contexts, templates, global/local prefixes, and per-element IPFIX — read-only with write operations gated behind the SSR pattern), `sdwan_snmp_config` (SNMP agents and trap destinations per element across v2.0/v2.1), `sdwan_event_correlation` (event correlation policy sets with per-set rules and correlation events query), `sdwan_perf_mgmt` (performance management policy sets, threshold profiles, and probe configs), and `sdwan_events_summary` (aggregated event counts by severity/category — a lighter alternative to `sdwan_events` for dashboard consumption). 28 total SD-WAN tools
- **Configuration Orchestration** (`tools/config_orch.py`) — 3 tools for the RNHP site-onboarding API (`sase/config-orch`, 32 endpoints, previously zero tooling): `scm_config_orch_remote_networks` (remote network CRUD + location informations), `scm_config_orch_bandwidth` (bandwidth allocation CRUD v1+v2), and `scm_config_orch_profiles` (IKE/IPSec crypto profile CRUD + IKE gateway reads). All write operations follow the SSR pattern: `dry_run=True` default with before/after diff, mandatory `ticket_ref` for provenance, commit is a separate explicit step. This is the first write-heavy tool family for site provisioning — a different API than the SCM Config API used by `scm_remote_network_list`
- **Newly catalogued small families** — 4 new tool modules scoped and built: `email_dlp.py` (`scm_email_dlp_incidents` — list incidents + retrieve reports from the Email DLP API), `dns_security.py` (`scm_dns_security_lookup` — domain category/reputation queries + change requests via the Advanced DNS Security API), `cdl_logforwarding.py` (`scm_cdl_logforwarding` — email/HTTPS/syslog log-forwarding profile listing from the CDL API), and 3 DLP incident tools added to existing `dlp.py` (`dlp_incidents_list`, `dlp_incidents_get`, `dlp_incidents_assignees` — v4 Beta + v1 GA DLP Incidents API). All degrade gracefully on unlicensed tenants. `cloudngfw/aws` (135 paths) deferred until a lab tenant with Cloud NGFW entitlement exists. Plus `family_probe.py` utility for scoping future families before scaffolding
- **Spec-schema request validation** (`utils/validation.py`) — pre-request validation layer using `jsonschema` (new dependency) to catch malformed query/body params before they hit the API (fewer opaque HTTP 400s). Validates against per-endpoint JSON Schemas from the OpenAPI catalog; gracefully degrades when no schema file exists. Injected at the Insights `_insights_call()` chokepoint (highest 400 rate per memory). V1 is advisory — logs warnings without blocking the call
- **MT Monitor round 3** (`tools/mt_monitor.py`) — 15 new views covering 22 previously unused catalog paths: alerts, threat-list, threat-source, app-source, incident-list, incident-trends, incident-tenants, incident-impacted, service-health (CDL status, gateway status, top outliers, unique users), url-summary, locations-tenants, tenant-hierarchy, license-setup, license-allocated, and app-monitor. 24 total views covering 34 of 36 catalog paths; `applications/list` (400) and `locationsUsers` (500) remain blocked on PAN spec refresh
- **Insights scheduled export workflow** (`tools/insights.py`) — `scm_insights_export` tool for the three-step Insights export pipeline: schedule → poll status → download. Supports v2 and v3 schedule endpoints; status/download use the v2 download endpoints. Also fixed a v3 path-building bug where `export/` and `download` paths incorrectly received a `/query/` prefix, making the two v3 export catalog paths unreachable through `scm_insights_query`

### Changed
- Planner manifest domain ceiling raised from 25 to 30 tools (sdwan domain grew to 28 with round 3)
- Tools manifest: 141 → 158 tools, 22 → 26 write tools across 11 domains

### Added (continued)
- **Planner Agent Phase 4 — MSSP cross-tenant layer** (`planner/estate.py`, `scm_estate_check`, console script `scm-planner-estate`) — the epic's differentiator over PANW's single-tenant model, completing the epic. One trigger fans out per-tenant sub-plans with bounded concurrency (default 3) through the same PlannerLoop; each tenant's contracted tier scopes its check depth — Bronze: licensing + certs + connectivity basics; Silver: + BPA posture + change audit; Gold: + NCSC CAF + ISO 27001 + DLP/SSPM posture (the three Gold assessments share one snapshot per tenant via the extractor's TTL cache). Cross-tenant anomaly rules flag what per-tenant analysis can't see: SD-WAN topology with zero active licences, duplicate NFR licence sets expiring across tenants (a real pattern on this estate), and provisioned-but-idle tenants (full bundles, zero config jobs) — each rule skips tenants whose facts couldn't be gathered rather than guessing. Read-only by construction (no approver wired); tests pin tier subsetting (bronze ⊂ silver ⊂ gold), the concurrency bound (peak-parallelism counter), and all three anomaly rules
- **Planner Agent Phase 3c — IR-triggered agent** (`planner/ir.py`, `scm_ir_trigger`, `POST /webhook/ir`) — the third and final trigger surface: an alert payload (MT Monitor webhook, incident search hit, or any bridge) is keyword-classified into an incident class and its pre-built triage template runs through the same PlannerLoop as every other trigger. tunnel-down runs exactly the epic's worked example (`sdwan_wan_ip_summary`, `scm_ike_gateway_list`, `scm_list_jobs`, `sdwan_events`) plus `scm_incident_rca` (drift off — triage stays fast); cert-expiry, licence-expiry, config-change, connectivity-degraded, and generic classes cover the rest. Templates are structurally write-free — the triage executor has no approver, and a test asserts no template names a write tool, so a forged alert cannot make the webhook execute a change. Runs in the background returning a plan_id (follow with `scm_planner_status`/`scm_planner_result`); the HTTP route sits behind the existing auth middleware and returns 202 with plan_id + incident class. Live-validated: a real tunnel-down triage ran all five steps against the lab tenant. This completes Phase 3 — all three trigger surfaces (scheduled, conversational, IR) now feed one loop

- **Compliance Center API tools** (`tools/compliance.py`) — `scm_compliance_center` (8 read actions: list frameworks, summaries with scores, overall compliance scoreboard, 30d/1y timeline, per-control pass/fail detail, assessed config counts, framework detail, benchmark monitoring) and `scm_compliance_framework` (6 write actions: create, update, delete, clone, benchmark, un-benchmark). Covers all 15 endpoints of PAN's new Compliance Center API (2026-07-14 release) at `api.strata.paloaltonetworks.com/posture/compliance-frameworks/v1`. 403 detection returns a licence-hint message matching the posture.py pattern. CLI: Posture menu item 3 (renumbered sequentially). 18 tests
- **SSR — Simple Service Requests** (`tools/ssr.py`) — `scm_ssr_execute`: machine-first JSON tool automating the three commonest MSSP customer change requests (URL allow/block-list, threat exceptions, SSL decrypt exclusions). All three reduce to add/remove in a designated SSR-managed object; never touches a rulebase. Idempotent (re-adding → `already_present`), dry-run default with before/after diff, mandatory `ticket_ref` echoed into descriptions for provenance. Per-tenant `ssr_objects` allowlist in settings.toml gates which objects the tool can touch. Commit stays a separate `scm_commit` step. 21 tests
- **Insights 2.0 — general-purpose query tool** (`tools/insights.py`) — `scm_insights_query` unlocks all 103 Insights paths (v1.0/v2.0/v3.0 + custom queries + scheduled exports) behind one interface with resource, body, api_version, and region parameters. Auto-resolves CDL region from tenant config; OAuth token refreshed before direct-session calls. 13 tests
- **MT Monitor round 2** (`tools/mt_monitor.py`) — `scm_mt_analytics` gains 5 new views: app-usage (applicationUsage), url-logs (urlLogs), upgrades (upgrades/list), locations (location/list — GET), and licenses (custom/license/quota + utilization — GET). Tool auto-detects GET vs POST based on view
- **CLI UX overhaul** — paginated 21-item Config & Inventory menu (5 section pages) and SD-WAN menu (3 section pages) with N/P navigation; 81 read-only leaf operations no longer pause for Enter (lists/reports flow continuously); confirmation prompts (y/N, default No) on Commit, Push, and Rollback; Posture menu renumbered sequentially 1-6 and MSSP Ops reorganised with SYSTEM section; "option 9" → "option S" in no-tenant messages; main menu Posture description updated

### Fixed
- **Insights rn_bw/sc_bw HTTP 400 — per-location RN/SC bandwidth was never extracted** (`audit/insights_extractor.py`) — `location_rn_bandwidth` and `location_sc_bandwidth` reject an empty request body with HTTP 400 GCP10002 ("Syntax error: Unexpected keyword AND" — the backend inlines the time predicate into a SQL template), and `extract_insights` sent `{}` to every location endpoint, so both bandwidth fields have been empty (and an error logged) on every AS-BUILT/Insights extraction since the extractor was added. The two bandwidth queries now send an explicit `event_time last_n_hours=24` filter; the status endpoints keep the empty body they accept. Live-validated on two lab tenants (region `uk`): both now return per-edge-location rows (`total_consumption`/`peak_consumption`/`rn_sites_up`) with zero extraction errors
- **Review sweep of the SSR / Insights / Compliance Center work** — `scm_ssr_execute` threat-exception now reports `status: "error"` when every configured profile fails, `commit_required` consistent across all handlers, explicit `tenant_id` with no match no longer falls back to another tenant's allowlist. `scm_insights_query` OAuth token refresh + no empty Prisma-Tenant header. Coverage: 13 insights tests, 4 SSR regression tests. Both live-validated read-only — `scm_ssr_execute` threat-exception now reports `status: "error"` when every configured profile fails (previously read "applied" with the failures tucked in `errors` — an orchestrator would have committed a no-op), `commit_required` is consistent across all handlers (True whenever a change is made or planned, False for pure no-ops), and an explicit `tenant_id` matching no configured tenant no longer falls back to *another tenant's* `ssr_objects` allowlist or default_folder (cross-tenant bleed). `scm_insights_query` now refreshes the OAuth token before direct-session calls (the stale-token trap every other Insights caller already guards) and no longer sends an empty `Prisma-Tenant` header. New coverage: 13 tests for the previously-untested `scm_insights_query` (URL construction per API version, region resolution, header rules, error pass-through) and 4 SSR regression tests. Both tools live-validated read-only: Insights returns real data and surfaces RBAC 403s cleanly; Compliance Center lists 7 real frameworks

### Added
- **Planner Agent Phase 3b — conversational copilot as MCP tools** (`tools/planner_tools.py`) — `scm_planner_run` feeds a natural-language operator goal into the same PlannerLoop with Claude (Opus 4.8) as the reasoning engine, running in the background and returning the plan_id immediately (asbuilt-job pattern); `scm_planner_status` streams progress by polling (per-step status/retries/summaries, or the run list); `scm_planner_result` returns the synthesized report. Write-tool approval in a conversation is the operator naming tools in `approved_write_tools` — explicit, per-run, default empty (fully read-only); anything unnamed is denied by the executor, never executed, and `scm_planner_run` itself is classified `access: write` in the manifest so no other planner can invoke it unattended. Any chat client connected to this server (Claude Desktop stdio, Copilot Studio Streamable) is the copilot frontend; a Slack/Teams bridge posts NLQs to the same tools. Also classified the new `scm_insights_query` tool in the manifest (the Phase 1 coverage test caught it unclassified — enforcement working as designed)
- **Planner Agent Phase 3a — scheduled ops agent** (`planner/nightly.py`, console script `scm-planner-nightly`) — the cron trigger surface: each tenant runs a deterministic template plan (tier assessment, cert scan, licence expiry ×2, incident summary, job audit) through the same PlannerLoop via a TemplateEngine (a nightly run's shape is policy, not reasoning — no LLM call), producing one estate digest with findings ranked severity → customer tier (Gold first) and per-tenant sections linking each full plan report. The epic's acceptance rules are computed mechanically from raw Subscription API rows and **both fired on live data**: the digest leads with "NFR/eval licences expiring within 90 days across 2 tenants (28 SKUs)" (estate CRITICAL), and the licensed-but-unused-shell rule is pinned in tests. Live-run lessons baked in: per-SKU findings aggregate per tenant (first estate run produced 176 findings; aggregation yields 5 readable ones) and estate findings lead their severity band (they previously sorted below the fold alphabetically). CLI: `--tenants` filter, `--no-tier-assess` fast path, `--slack-webhook`/`SCM_MCP_SLACK_WEBHOOK` delivery; cron example: `15 5 * * * cd /path/to/repo && uv run scm-planner-nightly`
- **Planner Agent Phase 2 — the loop core** (`planner/schema.py`, `store.py`, `executor.py`, `engine.py`, `loop.py`, `backend.py`) — Trigger → Plan → Execute → Observe → Revise → Synthesis → Report, implemented as a library invoked programmatically (Phase 3 adds the trigger surfaces). The persisted Plan matches the ARCHITECTURE.md schema exactly (plan_id, trigger, persona, tenant_scope, steps with status/result_summary/retries/timestamps, revision_history, final_report_ref) and every state change writes atomically to `plans/<plan_id>.json` (gitignored) with a JSONL audit log beside it — plans survive an MCP server restart and `resume()` re-queues only unfinished steps. The executor turns Phase 1's rails into runtime behavior: unclassified tools refused, write tools gated on an approval callback that **denies by default** when no approver is configured, manifest retry policy honoured (max 2 retries; fallback failures annotated with the documented fallback tool so revision can pick it up). The reasoning engine is Claude Opus 4.8 via `messages.parse()` structured outputs (Pydantic plan/revision drafts; params carried as JSON-string fields to satisfy strict schemas; refusal stop-reason handled) behind a Protocol — the 18 loop tests run on a scriptable fake, covering write-denial, bounded revision, retry semantics, resume-after-crash, and the always-finish-with-a-report guarantee (engine or synthesis failure degrades to a mechanical fallback report, never a silent abort). Credential convention matches `scm_ai_compliance_advisor` (`anthropic_api_key` in .secrets.toml)
- **Planner Agent Phase 1 — tool manifest & safety rails** (`resources/tools_manifest.yaml`, `planner/manifest.py`) — every registered MCP tool (135) classified with `access` (21 write tools), Expert-Agent `domain` (11 domains, each ≤ 21 tools so a sub-plan's context load stays well under the 128-tool Copilot Studio ceiling), `scope` (16 cross-tenant), `idempotent` (`scm_ssr_execute` is the sole idempotent write by design), `retry_policy`, and `known_failure_modes` populated from live-validated quirks (remote_network Pydantic fallback, zone_list default_folder trap, Insights/SD-WAN RBAC 403s, mt_analytics CDL-region drift, SDK "Invalid error response format" masking write-path 403s, async job + baseline prerequisites). The loader enforces the v1 hard rule: `requires_approval()` returns True for every write tool, takes only the tool name (no bypass flag), and raises `UnknownToolError` for unclassified tools rather than defaulting to unattended execution. Coverage is CI-enforced — `test_planner_manifest.py` registers all tools on a live FastMCP instance and fails if any tool lacks a manifest entry or an entry goes stale. New dependency: `pyyaml` (previously transitive)
- **`scm_incident_rca`** (`tools/audit.py`, `audit/incident_rca.py`) — incident → root-cause correlator: given an incident time (default now) and lookback window, ranks candidate causes by temporal proximity from config push/commit jobs (failed jobs rank ahead at equal distance; child jobs deduped via parent_id), certificate expiries (`expiry_epoch`), and licence expiries; config drift vs the drift baseline is presented separately as *state* evidence since extraction shows what differs, not when it changed. A 15-minute post-incident grace window catches clock skew/late symptom reports. Output ends with a customer-facing RFO draft citing the top candidate's evidence (job ID, cert CN, SKU) and an explicit correlation-not-causation caveat, plus a disclosure list of evidence sources the run could not check (Insights alerts RBAC, SD-WAN status, missing baseline). Live-validated: quiet window → honest "no correlated cause" RFO; anchored to a real licence-expiry date → 11 real expiries ranked with the top one cited in the draft
- **`scm_commit_preview`** (`tools/audit.py`, `audit/commit_preview.py`) — pre-commit blast-radius gate: extracts the current candidate config and compares it against the drift baseline (last known-good), reporting (1) every object the commit would add/remove/modify triaged HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW by enforcement impact, (2) rule shadowing introduced by new/changed security rules (conservative literal-value coverage check over from/to/source/destination/application/service — group/EDL membership not resolved, so flagged shadows are real; pre-existing shadows are filtered out via focus on the pending rules), and (3) the BPA delta — best-practice findings the change introduces or resolves, from running the check engine against both states. Verdict: 🔴 HIGH RISK (shadowing, new critical/high findings, or removals/modifications in enforcement sections) / 🟡 REVIEW / 🟢 LOW RISK / no-op, with next steps ending in `scm_commit` + `scm_drift_check(update_baseline=true)` to roll the baseline forward after an approved push. This is the governance gate the SSR/orchestration epics assume: the orchestrator owns sign-off, the gate gives sign-off something concrete to read
- **`scm_asbuilt_verify`** (`tools/audit.py`, `audit/asbuilt_verify.py`) — doc-vs-live verification for AS-BUILT documents: completed `scm_asbuilt_report` jobs now retain their extraction snapshot, and the verify tool re-extracts a fresh core snapshot (new `fresh=True` cache bypass on `extract_snapshot`) and diffs it section by section against the snapshot the document was built from. Reports per-section added/removed/modified objects with a ✅ DOCUMENT CURRENT / ⚠️ DRIFT DETECTED / ❓ PARTIALLY VERIFIED verdict, surfaces generation-time extraction gaps (e.g. RBAC 403s) separately from drift, and guards against live re-extraction failures reading as wholesale deletions. Live-validated on a lab tenant: clean baseline verdict across 23 sections, then all three drift directions (added rule, removed tag, modified service) detected and named after mutating the stored snapshot. Run it before handing a document to a customer
- **Drift sentinel** (`tools/audit.py`, `audit/drift_baseline.py`) — `scm_drift_baseline` captures known-good core config snapshots to disk (`SCM_MCP_BASELINE_DIR`, default `./baselines/`, gitignored — baselines hold full tenant config); `scm_drift_check` re-extracts live config and reports what changed since the baseline, triaged HIGH (security/NAT/decryption/auth rules, zones, VPN, identity, log forwarding) / MEDIUM (protection profiles, posture, EDLs) / LOW (address/service/tag plumbing) with the exact objects named. `all_tenants=true` sweeps every tenant as a background job (3 concurrent extractions; `scm_drift_result` fetches the digest) — designed as the overnight cross-tenant sentinel with `update_baseline=true` to accept explained changes as the new known-good. Baselines tolerate schema evolution (unknown fields dropped on load)
- **`scm_renewal_brief`** (`tools/ops.py`) — renewal-conversation brief combining subscription licences (contracted vs consumed seats, expiry), bandwidth allocations per compute location, and the live Insights v3.0 connected mobile-user count: renewal-window table for the chosen horizon (default 180 days), consumption-vs-contract signals (OVERSUBSCRIBED → true-up conversation, UNDERUSED → downsize risk), capacity snapshot, and generated talking points. `all_tenants=true` sweeps under the shared parallel poll budget. Live data drove two fixes: same-SKU bundles whose expirations differ only by seconds now group by expiry date (no duplicate rows/talking points), and pooled parent SKUs with `remaining > purchased` (negative consumption) read N/A instead of UNDERUSED
- **Planner Agent epic (roadmap + design stubs)** — new "Planner Agent — Agentic Orchestration Layer" epic in ROADMAP.md (PANW "NetSec Agents on SCM" taxonomy extended with an MSSP cross-tenant layer; four phases from tool manifest/safety rails through scheduled-ops MVP to estate fan-out), plus design stubs under `docs/planner-agent/`: ARCHITECTURE.md (taxonomy mapping table + persisted Plan JSON schema) and TOOL_MANIFEST.md (manifest spec with the write-tool and known-failure-mode entries populated; full 125-tool population TODO). Docs only — no implementation yet

## [0.10.0] - 2026-07-13

### Added
- **CLI: traffic-light PAN cloud status on the main menu** (`cli.py`) — the main menu banner now shows a live status light from the public statuspage feed (🟢 operational / 🟡🟠🔴 degraded with unresolved SASE incident count and a pointer to MSSP Ops → PAN Service Status; ⚪ when the feed is unreachable). Cached 5 minutes so menu redraws never refetch; short timeouts so a slow feed can't delay the menu
- **`scm_mt_analytics`** (`tools/mt_monitor.py`) — cross-tenant analytics over the `sase/mt-monitor` aggregation API (`agg_by=tenant`: a parent MSSP tenant answers for itself and all children). Views: apps (total/risky/blocked counts — live: 277 apps, 127 risky), threats (total/blocked — live: 228/101), connectivity (site counts by node type and up/down state per child tenant), incidents (raised counts by severity). Data lives in a CDL region (`X-PANW-Region`); when no region is given the tenant's insights_region is mapped and its eu/uk sibling also tried — the lab tenants say `eu` but hold data in `uk`. `applications/list` and `locationsUsers` are omitted: both reject or 500 on the spec's own example payloads. CLI: "Cross-Tenant Analytics" in MSSP Operations. (mt-notifications probed too: gateway path is `/mt/notifications/api/cloud/2.0/...` but current service accounts get 403 — parked with the other RBAC-blocked items)
- **PAN status banner on `scm_tenant_dashboard`** (`tools/ops.py`, `tools/service_status.py`) — when the PAN cloud status indicator is degraded, unresolved SASE incidents exist, or SASE maintenance is due within 7 days, the NOC dashboard shows a banner between the header and the tenant table (`🟡 PAN cloud status … — N unresolved SASE incident(s)` / `🔧 Next SASE maintenance …`). Fetched concurrently with the tenant rows via the shared `status_banner()` helper (short timeouts, silent on failure), so a slow or unreachable status page can never delay or break the dashboard. Healthy + quiet = no banner
- **`scm_service_maintenance`** (`tools/service_status.py`) — maintenance-window awareness from the public status.paloaltonetworks.com feed (Atlassian Statuspage; no auth/licence/RBAC, works even when tenant APIs are down): upcoming + in-progress scheduled maintenance filtered to the SASE/SCM product families this server manages (drops Prisma Cloud/Cortex noise — 26 raw windows → 6 relevant on first live run), matched against tenant regions via `TenantConfig.insights_region` with global windows always included; also reports the page's overall indicator and unresolved SASE incidents (live run surfaced the current Cloud NGFW Azure/AWS degradations). `all_tenants=true` groups windows per configured tenant. CLI: "PAN Service Status" entry in MSSP Operations
- **PAB evidence in CE/NCSC CAF compliance** (`audit/bpa_checks.py`, `audit/ncsc_controls.py`):
  - **BPA-PAB-001** (high) — every enrolled Prisma Browser device must pass the endpoint posture baseline (screen lock + disk encryption + host firewall); maps to CAF-B5.a and the new **CE-SC-1** (Secure Configuration — Device Baseline) control
  - **BPA-PAB-002** (low) — active browser enrolments unseen for >90 days are flagged as stale trusted-device inventory; maps to CAF-B5.a
  - Both checks skip cleanly when PAB is not provisioned; findings flow into the NCSC/CE gap reports automatically. First live run: 3/8 lab devices failing posture, 5 stale enrolments
- **PAB column in `scm_tenant_dashboard`** (`tools/ops.py`) — the NOC dashboard now shows Prisma Access Browser adoption and posture per tenant: `<users>u/<devices>d (<pct>%✓)` where the percentage is the share of devices passing **all three** posture checks (screen lock + disk encryption + firewall); unprovisioned tenants show "—". Single-page pulls inside the existing parallel per-tenant poll, so the 25 s dashboard budget is unaffected. First live run immediately surfaced a real gap: one lab tenant at 14% device posture compliance
- **PAB tenant depth** (`tools/pab.py`) — three read-only tools over the previously untooled `access/browser-mgmt` family (`/seb-api/v1/*`, 33 paths):
  - **`scm_pab_inventory`** — enrolled browser users, device inventory with endpoint posture (screen lock / disk encryption / firewall, mapped to booleans), user/device groups, and a summary view with posture-compliance roll-up; cursor pagination followed automatically
  - **`scm_pab_apps`** — configured application catalog (type/name filters), application categories, and app groups
  - **`scm_pab_user_requests`** — pending end-user browser access requests (the admin approve/deny queue)
  - Live-validated: base URL is `api.sase.paloaltonetworks.com/seb-api/v1` with common SASE bearer auth; note the subscription licenses API shows no `seb` entry even on tenants where the API serves data — provisioning is detected from the API itself (unprovisioned tenants return empty `/users` but 404/500 "tenant not found" on `/applications`), and the tools surface that distinctly
  - CLI: "PAB Inventory" and "PAB User Requests" entries in the SSE, DLP & CASB menu
- **`scm_saas_posture`** (`tools/posture.py`) — standalone SaaS Security Posture tool: onboarded SSPM apps with severity-ranked misconfiguration findings, Identity-SSPM IdP/NHI posture, and supported-app catalog capability counts (previously this data was only extracted inside compliance snapshots). Supports **manual export/import**: `save_to` writes the raw posture snapshot to JSON (format-tagged `scm-mcp-mssp/saas-posture@1`) for archiving/diffing, `load_from` renders a previous export offline without touching the API. Unlicensed (HTTP 500) and unprovisioned (404) tenants report clearly instead of erroring. CLI: new "SaaS Posture (SSPM)" entry in the Posture, Incidents & NOC menu with import/export prompts
- **Classic SD-WAN depth (round 2)** (`tools/sdwan.py`):
  - **`sdwan_flows`** — top talkers per site from the flow log: top sources / destinations / applications by bytes (app IDs resolved via appdefs), per-path-type breakdown, and dropped-flow count. The flow monitor takes one site per request
  - **`sdwan_app_health`** — healthscore buckets (good/fair/poor) for sites, circuits, and anynet links; top-N applications and sites by a selectable basis (traffic volume, TCP/UDP flows, transaction failures, or media metrics like egress audio MOS); per-app healthscore detail where app monitoring is enabled
  - **`sdwan_cellular_status`** — LTE/5G module inventory joined to live status: modem state, carrier, technology, signal strength, per-slot SIM state, roaming, and active firmware, with element/site names resolved
- **CLI: SD-WAN monitoring menu** (`cli_menus.py`) — the Prisma SD-WAN sub-menu gains a MONITORING section exposing events, software status, link health, flows/top talkers, app health, cellular modules, WAN IP summary (with optional ISP enrichment), audit logs, and the HTML site map — all reusing the tested MCP tool logic via `_call_mcp_tool`, which now primes the per-tenant config cache so SD-WAN tools resolve `tenant_id` correctly from the CLI
- **WAN IP enrichment layer 3 — record + cross-check** (`utils/ipenrich.py`, `audit/extractor.py`, `audit/asbuilt_report.py`, `tools/audit.py`, `tools/sdwan.py`):
  - **Persistent enrichment cache** — lookups now survive server restarts via an atomic local JSON cache (`~/.cache/scm-mcp-mssp/ipenrich.json`, 30-day TTL, keyed provider+IP), so repeat AS-BUILT runs cost zero third-party lookups
  - **Circuit resolution on every WAN IP record** — `extract_sdwan_wan_ips` now joins interface → site WAN interface → WAN network, adding `circuit_name` and `wan_network` to each record
  - **Drift flags (advisory)** — enriched records are checked two ways: observed ISP vs the configured WAN network/circuit label (token overlap; catches mis-patched or mis-labelled circuits) and IP geolocation vs the site's configured coordinates (>500 km haversine). Live run flagged 8/53 lab circuits whose generic labels hid a shared carrier egress
  - **AS-BUILT enrichment columns** — new `enrich_wan_ips` opt-in on `scm_asbuilt_report` adds Observed ISP (ASN) / IP Geolocation / Drift columns to §4.2.1 (SD-WAN, plus per-flag notes) and §3.4.7 (NGFW); §4.2.1 also gains a Circuit / WAN Network column unconditionally
  - **`sdwan_site_map`** — interactive Leaflet/OSM HTML map of SD-WAN sites from their configured coordinates (hubs/DCs red, branches blue; popups with address, IONs, circuits); sites without coordinates are listed as skipped
- **Classic Prisma SD-WAN depth — 5 new tools** against the already-wired `prisma-sase` client, all live-validated on a 16-site lab tenant (`tools/sdwan.py`):
  - **`sdwan_events`** — alarm/alert feed (POST `events/query` v3.7) with severity/code/site filters, active-only mode, event codes resolved to display names via the tenant's event-code catalog, and a by-severity/by-code summary
  - **`sdwan_audit_logs`** — controller audit trail (who changed what); renders a clear RBAC hint on the HTTP 403 that view-only service accounts get
  - **`sdwan_software_status`** — per-ION running version, staged-upgrade state (surfaced two stuck `download_cancelled` upgrades in the lab on first run), machine claim state, unclaimed inventory, upgrade jobs, and an estate-wide version histogram
  - **`sdwan_policy_rules`** — rule contents for path/QoS/NAT/NGFW-security/legacy-security policy sets plus set stacks (complements `sdwan_list_policies`, which only names the sets)
  - **`sdwan_link_health`** — per-path LQM latency/jitter/MOS (min/avg/max) plus site-level ingress/egress bandwidth from the monitor API; the API takes one path per LQM request and latency rejects the direction view jitter/MOS require, so paths are queried admin-up-first two calls each, capped by `max_paths`. `LqmPacketLoss` omitted — the API rejects every unit for it

- **SD-WAN site geo locations** — `sdwan_list_sites` returns each site's `location` (latitude/longitude); `sdwan_wan_ip_summary` attaches `site_address` + `site_location` to every WAN IP record (`tools/sdwan.py`)
- **WAN IP enrichment (opt-in `enrich=true`)** on `sdwan_wan_ip_summary` and `scm_ngfw_wan_ip_summary` — whatsmyip-style reverse lookup of each public WAN IP (ISP, organisation, ASN, reverse DNS, IP geolocation) via the new `utils/ipenrich.py`. Provider-pluggable (`ip_enrichment_provider` setting: ip-api.com batch by default, ipinfo.io + `ipinfo_token` optional), 6 h in-process cache, additive-only (lookup failures degrade to warnings). Opt-in because it sends tenant public IPs to a third-party service
- **Detected post-NAT public IP per ION element** — `sdwan_wan_ip_summary` now also returns `detected_public_ips`: the source address the cloud controller sees each element's config/events connection arriving from (element status `config_and_events_from`), i.e. the branch's real public egress even when the WAN interface holds an RFC1918 address behind upstream NAT
- **Widened endpoint catalog** — `gen_endpoint_catalog.py` now walks `sdwan`, `dlp`, `dns-security`, `cloudngfw`, `cdl`, `email-dlp` pan.dev spec trees in addition to `sase`/`scm`/`access`; catalog grew from 1,593 endpoints / 23 families to 3,871 endpoints / 30 families

### Fixed
- **SD-WAN element software version was always null** — elements carry `software_version`, not `sw_version`; fixed in `sdwan_list_elements`, `sdwan_topology`, and the AS-BUILT §4.1 edge-device inventory table, which all silently showed empty/Unknown versions
- **`extract_browser` never returned data** (`audit/extractor.py`, `tools/mssp.py`) — `_BROWSER_BASE` pointed at `/seb/api/v1`, which 404s (silently treated as not-licensed), so every `browser_*` snapshot field and the AS-BUILT §5 Prisma Browser section have been empty since the extractor was added. The real path is `/seb-api/v1`; a data-rich tenant now extracts 14 users / 8 devices / 100 applications / 3 device groups

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **`sdwan_wan_ip_summary`** / **`scm_ngfw_wan_ip_summary`** — live public/private WAN IP address per SD-WAN ION element interface, and NGFW interface IPs parsed from running-config XML (`tools/sdwan.py`, `tools/adnsr.py`)
- **AS-BUILT report** — SD-WAN WAN IP table (§4.2.1) with an IP-annotated topology diagram, and an NGFW WAN IP table (§3.4.7) (`audit/asbuilt_report.py`)

### Fixed
Found via a live sweep of all read-only tools across 8 tenants:
- **`security_rule.list()`'s rulebase kwarg is `rulebase`, not `position`** — 5 call sites, including the core audit extractor, silently ignored it, so every post-rulebase security rule was missing from every BPA/NCSC/ISO 27001/audit report
- **16 tools passed a dead `limit=` kwarg** into `pan-scm-sdk` `.list()` calls (silently swallowed into `**filters`) — always fetched the full result set regardless of the requested limit; now sliced client-side
- **`scm_remote_network_list`/`get` always 400'd** — the API requires `folder` to be literally `"Remote Networks"`, not the caller's folder
- **`sdwan_list_elements(site_id=...)` crashed** — the SDK method has no such kwarg
- **Cross-tenant dashboards** (`scm_incident_summary`/`search`) aborted entirely if one tenant had bad credentials instead of degrading per-tenant
- **`handle_scm_exception()` lost real error text for `APIError`** — its `__str__` omits `.message` when `details`/`status`/`error_code` are all unset

### Changed
- **`extract_snapshot()` now cached 120s per (tenant, folder)** — 8+ report tools each independently re-ran the same ~2 min / ~30-call extraction back-to-back
- Consolidated 3 duplicate tenant-config loaders and 6 duplicate `_fmt` JSON-formatting helpers into shared utils
- `docs/TOOL_REFERENCE.md` updated for the new tools

## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- **`scm_spi_status`** — Service Provider Interconnect visibility (pan.dev `sase/mt-interconnect`, Feb 2026): one view-based tool covering interconnect summary/inventory, physical connections, SPI regions, tenant settings, and IP-pool usage monitoring; actionable 401/403/404/5xx messages for accounts without an MSP role (`tools/mt_interconnect.py`)
- **`scm_pab_msp_summary` / `scm_pab_msp_report`** — Prisma Access Browser for MSP reporting (pan.dev `sase/pab-msp`, Feb 2026): region-level user/tenant/CIE roll-ups and per-TSG security-event reports (blocked malware, websites, extensions, category breakdowns) — browser-control evidence for CE/NCSC reporting (`tools/pab_msp.py`)
- **`scripts/gen_tool_from_spec.py`** — spec-driven tool scaffolding: emits read-only MCP tool scaffolds (typed query params, docstrings, graceful 4xx/5xx rendering) for any endpoint-catalog family, fetching specs pinned to the catalog's pan.dev commit; scaffolds are curated into consolidated tools before registration
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — tracks new pan.dev API families and planned coverage (SPI in AS-BUILT/NOC, PAB posture columns, Config Orchestration site-based RN, mt-monitor aggregates, Insights 2.0, 5G)
- **pan.dev endpoint catalog** — bundled index of 1,593 endpoints across 23 API families generated from the MIT-licensed pan.dev OpenAPI specs (`sase`, `scm`, `access` trees) with per-file git blob SHAs (`resources/endpoint_catalog.json` + loader `resources/endpoint_catalog.py`, regenerate via `scripts/gen_endpoint_catalog.py`); REST fallbacks in `audit.extractor` now resolve SDK resource names to their exact documented URL (override → SDK `ENDPOINT` → catalog → naive slug) instead of guessing a slug; `scm_check_updates` gains an **OpenAPI Spec Drift** section that diffs the bundled catalog's blob SHAs against the live pan.dev tree (4 unauthenticated GitHub API calls) and reports new/changed/removed spec files — new API families like SP Interconnect or Prisma Browser for MSP now surface automatically

### Fixed
- **`docs/TOOL_REFERENCE.md` regenerated (84 → 108 tools)** — `scripts/gen_docs.py` silently skipped modules missing from its hardcoded section list; it now auto-discovers every `tools/*.py` with `@mcp.tool()` functions (curated titles with docstring-derived fallback), emits GitHub-correct heading anchors, escapes pipes in parameter tables, and is tracked in the repo

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-03

First public release (squash-published snapshot; development history remains private).

### Added
- **DOCX works out of the box** — `pypandoc-binary` dependency bundles pandoc; `_find_pandoc()` resolves system pandoc first, bundled binary as fallback
- `settings.example.toml` template; the tenant registry (`settings.toml`) is git-ignored

### Fixed
- **AS-BUILT document quality** — SDK enums render as wire values (`model_dump(mode="json")`), empty table cells normalise to "—", dict/list cells unwrapped, §2.1 architecture diagram draws only compute locations actually in use, mmdc diagram rendering self-heals via Chrome discovery + `--no-sandbox` retry (DOCX embeds PNGs again)
- **CLI** — four menu ops called non-existent helpers (tenant/NOC dashboards, licence forecast, tier catalogue, config clone); config-versions API moved to `/config/operations/v1` with per-scope running-version tracking; DOCX conversion failure reports honestly and saves Markdown instead
- **CI type-check greened** — mypy 103 → 0 errors

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **`scm_iso27001_assess`** — assessment of SCM/NGFW configuration against ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A; maps all 39 BPA checks to 12 automatable controls (A.5.14 Information transfer, A.5.28 Collection of evidence, A.8.7 Malware protection, A.8.15 Logging, A.8.20 Network security, A.8.21 Network services/TLS, A.8.22 Network segregation, A.8.23 Web filtering, A.8.24 Cryptography, A.8.27 Secure architecture, A.8.28 Secure coding, A.8.29 Security testing); per-control compliance status with failing BPA checks and evidence guidance; overall verdict CONFORMING / MINOR NONCONFORMITY / MAJOR NONCONFORMITY; `clause_filter` parameter scopes to clause 5, 8, or specific control (e.g. 'A.8.22'); out-of-scope controls (governance, people, physical) explicitly noted; Markdown and JSON output (`tools/audit.py`, `audit/iso27001_controls.py`)
- **`scm_decrypt_policy_audit`** — deep-dive SSL/TLS decryption policy audit for a SCM folder; assesses profile quality (TLS min version ≥ 1.2, weak algorithm flags — 3DES, RC4, MD5, SHA-1, static RSA, forward-proxy block settings for expired/untrusted/unknown certs and unsupported versions), rule coverage (decrypt vs no-decrypt ratio, zone pairs, presence of any-any catch-all rule, disabled rules, rules missing a profile, inbound inspection), gap analysis with NCSC CAF D3.b and DSPT Standard 9 cross-references, and an overall verdict of ADEQUATE / PARTIAL / INSUFFICIENT; Markdown and JSON output (`tools/audit.py`)
- **`scm_dspt_assess`** — automated assessment of SCM/NGFW configuration against the NHS Data Security and Protection Toolkit (DSPT 2024-25 v5.1); covers technology Standards 7 (Continuity), 8 (Unsupported Systems), 9 (IT Protection), and 10 (Accountable Suppliers); maps all 39 BPA checks to 16 DSPT assertions; outputs per-assertion compliance status with DSPT-portal-ready evidence statements and overall level (Approaching / Meeting / Exceeding Standards); Markdown and JSON output with optional file save (`tools/audit.py`, `audit/dspt_controls.py`)
- **`scm_incident_search`** — search SCM security incidents via `POST /incidents/v1/search` with client-side filtering by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low), status (Open/Closed/Acknowledged), product, and acknowledgement state; traffic-light emoji severity; multi-tenant `all_tenants=True` sweep (`tools/posture.py`)
- **`scm_incident_summary`** — cross-tenant NOC dashboard; counts Critical/High/Medium/Low/Total incidents per tenant with latest critical incident title; ideal for morning SLA briefings and MSSP weekly reports (`tools/posture.py`)
- **`scm_posture_report`** — retrieves Posture Management best-practice reports via `GET /posture/v1/reports`; graceful licence-gate handling (403 → actionable message) for tenants without the Posture Management add-on (`tools/posture.py`)
- **`scm_adnsr_list`** — list Advanced DNS Security Resolver resources (profiles, internal-domains, connection-sources, custom-fqdns, edl-definitions, misconfigured-domains, resolver-info, ca-certs) via `GET /adns-resolver/v1/{resource}`; licence-gate handling for tenants without the ADNSR subscription (`tools/adnsr.py`)
- **`scm_adnsr_profile_create`** — create an ADNSR DNS security profile with configurable default action (sinkhole/block/allow) and query logging via `POST /adns-resolver/v1/profiles` (`tools/adnsr.py`)
- **`scm_ngfw_local_config_list`** — list configuration versions pushed to a specific SCM-managed NGFW device via `GET /sse/config/v1/local-config/versions`; NGFW Operations entitlement required (`tools/adnsr.py`)
- **`scm_ngfw_local_config_get`** — fetch the XML configuration for a specific NGFW local config version (or `version="running"`) to enable automated BPA via `scm_aiops_bpa`; NGFW Operations entitlement required (`tools/adnsr.py`)
- **`scm_aiops_bpa`** — submit a PAN-OS device running config XML to the AIOps BPA API (`api.stratacloud.paloaltonetworks.com/aiops/bpa/v1`); implements the full 5-step workflow (POST `/requests` with device metadata → signed S3 upload URL → PUT XML → poll `/jobs/{id}` → GET `/reports/{id}` download URL → fetch and parse report); requires `requester_email` (a PANW CSP email registered in the AIOps BPA portal), `device_serial`, `device_family`, `device_model`, `device_version` as optional device metadata; renders findings as Markdown with overall score, per-category scores, and failing checks grouped by severity with recommendations; complements the 39 SCM SDK-based BPA checks with PAN's own device-level assessment engine (`tools/aiops.py`)
- **`scm_cert_lifecycle`** — multi-tenant TLS certificate lifecycle dashboard with `all_tenants=True` sweep across all MSSP tenants; identifies probable SSL inspection CA certs (name/CN heuristic) and flags them CRITICAL separately because expiry silently disables SSL decryption; produces cross-tenant summary table (total / flagged / SSL-CA critical / worst expiry) for NOC morning brief (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_cert_import`** — import a PEM certificate into any SCM tenant folder via `POST /config/v1/certificates`; marks CA vs leaf type; prompts to commit after import (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_tls_profile_manager`** — list (`action='list'`) or create (`action='create'`) TLS service profiles via `GET/POST /config/v1/tls-service-profiles`; created profiles default to TLS 1.2 minimum, AES-GCM only, no 3DES/RC4/SHA-1 — the NCSC-recommended cipher baseline (`tools/ops.py`)
- **BPA-SR-009** — NSF-ZT-1 zero trust rule specificity: flags allow rules where both `source=any` AND `destination=any`, giving zero network-level segmentation; distinct from BPA-SR-007 (which requires `app=any` too) and catches application-specific but location-unrestricted rules (`audit/bpa_checks.py`)
- **BPA-SR-010** — CE-FW-2 unauthenticated protocol exposure: flags allow rules that explicitly name unauthenticated or cleartext protocols (telnet, FTP, TFTP, rsh, rlogin, rexec, finger, SNMPv1/v2c, NetBIOS variants) with per-rule detail of which protocols are exposed and encrypted alternatives in remediation (`audit/bpa_checks.py`)
- NSF-ZT-1 and CE-FW-2 NCSC cross-references added to `BPA_TO_NCSC` for both new checks (`audit/ncsc_controls.py`)
- **`scm_config_versions`** — list all SCM config versions with commit timestamps, descriptions, admin, and human-readable age; marks the currently active running version; uses `GET /config/v1/config-versions` + `GET /config/v1/config-versions/running` (`tools/deployment.py`)
- **`scm_config_push_track`** — async config push with 10-second job polling, rich result table (duration, job ID, status %, warnings, device details), and optional `rollback_on_failure=True` that automatically loads the pre-push running version back to candidate if the job fails (`tools/deployment.py`)
- **`scm_config_rollback`** — load any saved config version back to candidate via `POST /config/v1/config-versions/{version}:load`; shows original commit metadata for confirmation; optional `commit_immediately=True` to push the rollback in one call (`tools/deployment.py`)
- **BPA-TP-007** — WildFire profile content coverage check: verifies profiles cover all high-risk file types (PE, PDF, MS-Office, JAR, ELF, APK, Flash) with direction=both and a block action on malicious verdicts; profiles with narrow file-type rules or missing block actions are flagged (`audit/bpa_checks.py`)
- **BPA-URL-002** — URL access profile block-category verification: checks that every URL access profile has explicit block rules for high-risk categories (malware, phishing, command-and-control, hacking, proxy-avoidance, dynamic-dns); profiles missing these blocks are listed as affected objects (`audit/bpa_checks.py`)
- **BPA-DEC-002** — Decryption rule coverage check: verifies that at least one decryption rule with `action=decrypt` is active in the rulebase; distinguishes between no profiles, no rules, and rules-but-only-exclusions failure modes (`audit/bpa_checks.py`)

### Changed
- **`scm_spn_bandwidth`** — now queries Prisma Access Insights v3.0 for live per-SPN throughput (Mbps in/out, 5-minute rolling average) and shows utilisation % against configured allocation; gracefully falls back to allocation-only mode if the tenant token lacks Insights scope (`tools/ops.py`, new `_insights_spn_throughput` helper)
- **`scm_tenant_dashboard`** — "Nearest Expiry" now excludes already-expired SKUs by default so the licence RAG reflects active renewal health rather than a long-dead legacy SKU (e.g. an old logging_service Production License) pinning every tenant to EXPIRED; new `include_expired=True` parameter restores the nearest-across-all-SKUs behaviour, and a tenant whose licences are all expired still flags red via a worst-SKU fallback (`tools/ops.py`, new `_nearest_licence_expiry` helper)
- **HTTP server** — bind address is now configurable via `SCM_MCP_HTTP_HOST` (defaults to `0.0.0.0` for containers) instead of being hardcoded (`server_http.py`)

### Tooling
- Re-enabled mypy type-checking on 7 of 8 previously-`ignore_errors` modules (only `audit/asbuilt_report` remains); fixed 3 latent type issues in `audit/insights_extractor` and `tools/mssp`
- Aligned the bandit SAST gate between CI and pre-commit (both fail on MEDIUM+); granted `pull-requests: read` to the PR-title and gitleaks CI jobs (previously 403-failing on every PR); resolved 5 MEDIUM bandit findings with real fixes / justified `nosec`
- Bumped all GitHub Actions to latest majors (`checkout` v7, `upload-artifact` v7, `setup-uv` v7, `build-push-action` v7, `setup-buildx-action` v4, `metadata-action` v6)
- Added 23 unit tests for the `tools/ops.py` pure helpers (cert/licence status thresholds, semver comparison, nearest-expiry selection)

### Added
- **`scm_cert_scan`** — scan all certificate objects across Shared, Remote Networks, Mobile Users, and Service Connections; flags CRITICAL (<30d), WARNING (<60d), CAUTION (<90d), EXPIRED; cross-references IKE gateways using cert auth vs PSK (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_licence_forecast`** — licence expiry and seat utilisation per tenant; groups by app_id + expiry date, flags oversubscribed pools, `all_tenants=True` sweeps every MSSP tenant in one call (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_tenant_dashboard`** — lightweight NOC wallboard; rules, remote networks, IKE tunnels, nearest licence expiry, and RAG status for every MSSP tenant in a single Markdown table; targeted REST calls only, no full snapshot extraction (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_spn_bandwidth`** — SPN bandwidth allocation vs branch count; per-branch Mbps share, HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW oversubscription risk rating, QoS config, full branch roster per SPN, `all_tenants=True` mode (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_gp_session_summary`** — live GP + Prisma Access Agent session count by country (GeoIP), compute node, client type, and GP version; compares connected sessions against licensed MU seat capacity and shows utilisation%; privacy-safe (aggregate counts only, no usernames or IPs) (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_check_updates`** — checks PyPI for latest versions of `pan-scm-sdk`, `prisma-sase`, `mcp`, and `scm-mcp-mssp`; fetches `pan-scm-sdk` GitHub release notes and recent `pan.dev` SASE API commit log; shows 🟢/🟡/⚪ status per package (`tools/ops.py`)
- **`scm_restart`** — schedules a clean SIGTERM after returning the response so Claude Desktop or a supervisor can automatically reconnect; configurable `delay_seconds` (default 3, min 1) (`tools/reload.py`)
- **CLI: Check for Updates (`U`)** — new MANAGEMENT menu option; rich table of PyPI versions + pan-scm-sdk release notes + pan.dev SASE API recent commits (`cli.py`)
- **CLI: Restart MCP Server (`R`)** — new MANAGEMENT menu option; finds running `scm-mcp` / `scm-mcp-http` processes with `pgrep`, sends SIGTERM, offers to restart in background (`cli.py`)
- **Unique AS-BUILT Document ID** — every generated AS-BUILT now receives an `ASBUILT-YYYYMMDD-<8hex>` stamp shown in the document header and §1 Document Control table
- **Appendix E — SCM Configuration Change History** (§8.7) — last 20 SCM commits with date, user, type, result, and description automatically appended to every AS-BUILT

### Changed
- **HLD → AS-BUILT rebrand** — `hld_report.py` → `asbuilt_report.py`, `HLDReportBuilder` → `AsBuiltReportBuilder`, MCP tool `scm_hld_report` → `scm_asbuilt_report`, stamp prefix `HLD-` → `ASBUILT-`, output filenames `*-hld.*` → `*-asbuilt.*`; all docstrings, CLI labels, and docs updated
- **Reference architecture diagrams moved to Appendix F** (§8.8) — all four PAN Mermaid diagrams (Enterprise SASE, Prisma Access routing, SD-WAN dual-hub, MSSP hierarchy) removed from main body sections §2–§8; live AS-BUILT topology in §2.1 remains in the main body
- **Removed §8 MSSP Service & BAU Support Model** from AS-BUILT report — generic RACI/ITSM/escalation boilerplate replaced by live operational data tools; old §9 Appendices renumbered to §8

### Fixed
- **`oauth.token_expires_soon()` TypeError** — `token_expires_soon` is a `@property`, not a method; removed erroneous `()` call in `fetch_licenses`, `insights_extractor`, and `scm_mobile_user_stats` token-refresh paths

### Security
- **Purged customer report files from git history** — three previously committed report files removed from all commits using `git filter-repo`; force-pushed to GitHub
- **Hardened `.gitignore`** — `reports/`, `*.docx`, `*hld*.md`, `*asbuilt*.md`, `*bpa-*.md`, `*ncsc-*.md`, `tenant-*.md`, `backups/`, `ai-design-components/` (plus local-only customer-prefixed globs in `.git/info/exclude`); generated reports will never be accidentally committed

### Known Gaps


- `scm_aiops_bpa` integrated and working but requires **AIOps BPA portal registration**: the API (`/aiops/bpa/v1/requests`) validates `requesterEmail` against PAN's AIOps BPA user database independently of PANW CSP auth — service account emails (`.iam.panserviceaccount.com`) are rejected as the portal requires a registered human CSP user email; contact bpa@paloaltonetworks.com or register at aiops.paloaltonetworks.com to enable; once enabled the tool is fully functional
- No CRUD on: services, service groups, decryption rules, application override rules
- No identity/auth server profile CRUD (RADIUS, LDAP, SAML, TACACS+, Kerberos) — list only via extractor
- GlobalProtect Mobile Agent config resources (agent profiles, tunnel profiles) available in SDK v0.15.0 but no dedicated CRUD MCP tools yet
- `scm_posture_report`, `scm_adnsr_*`, and `scm_ngfw_local_config_*` are implemented but return 403 in non-subscribed tenants — Posture Management and Advanced DNS Security Resolver require separate PAN add-on subscriptions; NGFW Operations requires the NGFW Operations entitlement on the TSG

## [0.4.7] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- `scm_browser_list` — Prisma Browser (RBI) device/user/application group inventory via `/seb/api/v1/`
- `scm_airs_list` — Prisma AIRS (AI Runtime Security) customer apps, profiles, and deployment profiles
- `scm_ngfw_device_list` — NGFW managed devices with model, serial, HA state, and connection status
- GlobalProtect agent profile and tunnel profile sections in AS-BUILT report (§3 Mobile Users)
- NGFW health and HA status sections added to AS-BUILT report

### Fixed
- SD-WAN `sdwan_list_wan_interfaces` and `sdwan_debug_topology` API path corrections
- Mobile-agent REST fallback URLs corrected for GP agent/tunnel profile endpoints

## [0.4.6] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- `scm_ai_compliance_advisor` — AI-powered compliance advisor combining NCSC/NIST gap checks with Claude-generated executive summary and remediation playbook (`tools/ai_advisor.py`)
- `scm_nist_gap` — NIST CSF v2.0 / SP 800-53 Rev 5 gap analysis remapping NCSC structural checks to NIST control identifiers
- `scm_create_nist_snippet` — create reusable SCM snippet with NIST-compliant security profiles and NIST-Compliant tag

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- `scm_create_ncsc_snippet` — create a reusable SCM snippet containing NCSC-compliant security profiles (anti-spyware, vulnerability, WildFire, URL, log forwarding, tag); distinct from folder-scoped `scm_apply_ncsc_baseline`
- AS-BUILT report: Markdown-to-Word (docx) conversion via `python-docx`; `output_format='docx'` now works without pandoc

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- `scm_list_jobs` — list SCM commit/push jobs with username, type, result, and timestamps for commit audit history
- Tenant metadata cache: tenant label and region stored at auth time for use in AS-BUILT and tier reports

### Fixed

#### MSSP Tier System (`audit/tiers.py`)
- `TierDefinition` frozen dataclass — specifies required BPA check severities, NCSC framework scope, SCM snippet names, and commercial feature description per tier
- Three tier definitions:
  - **Bronze** — Cyber Essentials baseline: Critical-only BPA checks, CE v3.2 framework, 2 SCM snippets (`MSSP-Bronze-SecurityProfiles`, `MSSP-Bronze-Policies`)
  - **Silver** — Cyber Essentials Plus: Critical + High BPA checks, CE v3.2 + 10 Steps, 4 SCM snippets (adds WildFire, DNS security, log forwarding, zone protection)
  - **Gold** — NCSC CAF v4.0 full: All BPA checks (Critical + High + Medium + Low), all frameworks, 6 SCM snippets (adds SSL/TLS decryption profiles + policies)
- `score_findings_against_tier(findings, tier)` — separates findings into tier-required breaches vs out-of-scope advisory, returns compliance score percentage
- `upgrade_gap(findings, from_tier, to_tier)` — identifies blocking findings, new NCSC controls, and additional snippets needed to upgrade tier
- `SNIPPET_TEMPLATES` — content specifications for all 12 tier SCM snippets (Bronze ×2, Silver ×4, Gold ×6); used by onboarding tool to guide snippet creation
- `TIER_ORDER` list (`["bronze", "silver", "gold"]`) for ordered tier traversal
- Tier hierarchy is a strict superset chain: every Silver requirement is also a Gold requirement; every Bronze requirement is also a Silver requirement

#### MCP Tools — MSSP Tier Management (`tools/mssp.py`)
- `mssp_tier_assess` — score a folder against a contracted tier; returns JSON with `tier_compliant`, `compliance_score_pct`, `breaches`, `advisory`, and automatic upgrade gap count
- `mssp_tier_report` — customer-facing Markdown compliance report with visual compliance bar, breach remediation steps, advisory upsell context, and upgrade path section; optional `save_to` path
- `mssp_upgrade_path` — JSON gap analysis between any two tiers: blocking findings, additional NCSC controls, snippets to apply, new features
- `mssp_onboard_tenant` — checks which tier snippets exist in SCM, associates present ones with the customer folder; `dry_run=True` by default to preview before execution; `create_folder=True` creates the folder if needed
- `mssp_tenant_dashboard` — Markdown dashboard of all currently loaded MSSP tenants
- `mssp_snippet_catalogue` — Markdown catalogue of all tier snippet templates and content specifications, filterable by tier
- `mssp_tier_comparison` — side-by-side Gold / Silver / Bronze feature comparison table (suitable for sales / customer conversations)

#### TenantConfig additions (`config/settings.py`)
- `tier: ServiceTier` field (default `"bronze"`) — `Literal["gold", "silver", "bronze"]`; loaded from `settings.toml` `[tenants.*]` blocks
- `service_term_years: int` field (default `1`, range 1–3) — contract duration in years
- `account_ref: str` field — CRM / ticketing system reference for cross-system linking
- `ServiceTier` type alias exported from `config/settings.py`

#### Settings template (`settings.toml`)
- `[tenants.*]` block template extended with `tier`, `service_term_years`, and `account_ref` fields with inline documentation
- Tier descriptions added as comments explaining the three-tier NCSC framework mapping

#### Tests (`tests/unit/test_tiers.py`)
- 33 new unit tests across 5 test classes:
  - `TestTierDefinitions` — existence, hierarchy (superset chain), NCSC coverage, snippet non-empty
  - `TestTierScoring` — breach vs advisory separation at each tier, WARN counts as breach, compliance score maths
  - `TestUpgradeGap` — blocking detection, new snippet identification, NCSC control delta, two-tier skip
  - `TestTenantConfigTierField` — default values, accepted values, optional fields

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

#### Audit Engine (`audit/` subpackage)
- `AuditSnapshot` dataclass — flat, SDK-agnostic representation of all auditable SCM config for a folder/tenant
- `AuditExtractor` (`audit/extractor.py`) — pulls 30+ resource types from SCM via the SDK into an `AuditSnapshot`; non-fatal per-resource error capture so partial data still produces findings
- `Finding` dataclass with `Severity` (critical/high/medium/low/info) and `Status` (fail/pass/warn/skip) enums
- `bpa_checks.py` — 21 PAN Best Practice Assessment checks across six categories:
  - **Security Rules** (SR-001–008): no-profile allow rules, permit-any-any, logging at session end, disabled rule hygiene, app-any allow rules, deny rule logging, unrestricted outbound, explicit deny-all
  - **Threat Prevention** (TP-001–006): anti-spyware with DNS sinkholing, DNS security profiles, vulnerability protection profiles, WildFire profiles, file blocking profiles, SSL/TLS decryption profiles
  - **URL Filtering** (URL-001): URL category configuration check
  - **Zone Protection** (ZP-001): zones without zone protection profiles
  - **Logging** (LOG-001–003): log forwarding profiles, syslog server profiles, allow rules missing log forwarding
  - **Network** (NET-001–002): minimum zone segmentation, remote network IPSec configuration
- `ncsc_controls.py` — 16 NCSC control definitions across four frameworks:
  - CAF v4.0 (August 2025): B2.a/b/c, B3.a/b, B4.a, C1.a/b
  - Cyber Essentials v3.2: CE-FW-1/2/3/4
  - 10 Steps to Cyber Security: 10S-NS-1/2/3, 10S-TP-1
  - Network Security Fundamentals: NSF-ZT-1, NSF-LOG-1
- `BPA_TO_NCSC` mapping — cross-references every BPA check ID to its applicable NCSC control IDs
- `ReportBuilder` (`audit/report.py`) — renders findings as structured JSON (SIEM-ingestible) or Markdown (AS-BUILT AS-IS document) with executive summary, config inventory table, severity-grouped findings with remediation, NCSC control index

#### MCP Tools — Audit (`tools/audit.py`)
- `scm_config_backup` — exports complete config snapshot to timestamped JSON file; records resource counts and non-fatal extraction errors; respects `SCM_MCP_BACKUP_DIR` env var
- `scm_bpa_assess` — runs all BPA checks against live SCM config; supports `severity_filter` and `failed_only` parameters; returns JSON findings with NCSC cross-references
- `scm_ncsc_assess` — control-by-control NCSC compliance view; filterable by framework (`caf`/`ce`/`10steps`/`all`); returns compliant/non-compliant/not-assessed per control with linked findings
- `scm_audit_report` — combined BPA + NCSC Markdown or JSON report (AS-BUILT); optional `save_to` path writes report to disk
- `scm_config_diff` — compares two backup JSON files; returns structured diff of added/removed/modified objects per resource type; suitable for pre/post change-window auditing
