"""
Planner Phase 3b — the conversational trigger surface, as MCP tools.

Any chat client connected to this server (Claude Desktop over stdio,
Copilot Studio over the Streamable transport, a Slack/Teams bridge posting
into either) becomes the copilot frontend: an operator states a goal in
natural language, scm_planner_run feeds it into the SAME PlannerLoop as
every other trigger, and the conversation follows progress through
scm_planner_status and collects the synthesis through scm_planner_result.

Write-tool approval in a conversation is the operator naming the tools:
scm_planner_run(approved_write_tools=["scm_commit"]) is the explicit human
approval the Phase 1 hard rule requires — scoped to this run, default
empty, and anything not named is denied by the executor, never executed.

Runs execute on a daemon thread (plan generation is an LLM call and steps
take minutes) — the tool returns the plan_id immediately, exactly like the
scm_asbuilt_report job pattern.
