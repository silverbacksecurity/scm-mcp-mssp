"""Family probe helper — discover which API families a tenant can access.

Used before scaffolding tools for newly-catalogued families.  Probes each
family's base URL with the tenant's bearer token and reports the HTTP status
code so we know whether the tenant is entitled, blocked by RBAC, or the API
simply doesn't exist at that URL.

Usage:
    from scm_mcp_mssp.utils.family_probe import probe_family
    results = probe_family(base_url, client, paths=["/v1/some/endpoint"])
    # results = {"/v1/some/endpoint": 200, ...}
